<p>The Interact Club of Pokhara Lakeside is a dynamic, youth-led nonprofit organization affiliated with Rotary International. Established on July 1, 2021, it holds the distinction of being the first and only community-based Interact club in Pokhara, welcoming young individuals between the ages of 12 and 18.

Since its founding, the club has been actively involved in a wide range of impactful initiatives focused on community service, leadership development, education, health, and social empowerment.

More than just a volunteering platform, the Interact Club of Pokhara Lakeside is a space for young people to grow, lead, and serve with purpose. For the Rotary year 2025/2026, the club proudly embraces the theme “Elevate Through Service,” motivating members to uplift both their communities and themselves through meaningful, compassionate action.</p>                </div>
